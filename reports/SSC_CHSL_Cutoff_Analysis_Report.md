## Abstract

The Staff Selection Commission Combined Higher Secondary Level (SSC CHSL) examination is one of the largest competitive recruitment examinations in India, with cut-off marks varying significantly across posts and categories. This study presents a five-year longitudinal analysis of SSC CHSL Tier-I cut-off trends from 2019 to 2023, focusing on post-wise and category-wise variations and their relationship with competition density. Official cut-off data was collected from SSC result write-up documents, while candidate participation figures were estimated using secondary sources due to the absence of officially published category-wise appearance data. The dataset was cleaned using spreadsheet tools, structured using a relational database schema, and analyzed using Python. The findings indicate that competition density and post preference are the dominant structural factors influencing cut-off variations, while year-to-year exam difficulty plays a comparatively limited role.

## 1. Introduction

The SSC CHSL examination serves as a key recruitment channel for clerical and data entry positions in various government departments, including posts such as Lower Division Clerk/Junior Secretariat Assistant (LDC/JSA), Postal Assistant/Sorting Assistant (PA/SA), and Data Entry Operator (DEO). Each year, the examination attracts a large and diverse pool of candidates, resulting in intense competition and closely observed cut-off trends.

Unlike examinations that declare a single qualifying threshold, SSC CHSL cut-offs differ across posts and reservation categories, reflecting variations in vacancy distribution, candidate preference, and competition intensity. Despite frequent discussion among aspirants, systematic and data-driven analysis of these cut-off variations remains limited.

This study aims to address this gap by conducting a structured, longitudinal analysis of SSC CHSL Tier-I cut-off data over a five-year period. By integrating post-wise and category-wise perspectives with estimated competition density, the study seeks to identify the structural factors that consistently influence cut-off behavior and to demonstrate a reproducible, database-driven approach to examination data analysis.
