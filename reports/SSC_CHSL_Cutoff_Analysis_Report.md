## Abstract

The Staff Selection Commission Combined Higher Secondary Level (SSC CHSL) examination is one of the largest competitive recruitment examinations in India, with cut-off marks varying significantly across posts and categories. This study presents a five-year longitudinal analysis of SSC CHSL Tier-I cut-off trends from 2019 to 2023, focusing on post-wise and category-wise variations and their relationship with competition density. Official cut-off data was collected from SSC result write-up documents, while candidate participation figures were estimated using secondary sources due to the absence of officially published category-wise appearance data. The dataset was cleaned using spreadsheet tools, structured using a relational database schema, and analyzed using Python. The findings indicate that competition density and post preference are the dominant structural factors influencing cut-off variations, while year-to-year exam difficulty plays a comparatively limited role.

## 1. Introduction

The SSC CHSL examination serves as a key recruitment channel for clerical and data entry positions in various government departments, including posts such as Lower Division Clerk/Junior Secretariat Assistant (LDC/JSA), Postal Assistant/Sorting Assistant (PA/SA), and Data Entry Operator (DEO). Each year, the examination attracts a large and diverse pool of candidates, resulting in intense competition and closely observed cut-off trends.

Unlike examinations that declare a single qualifying threshold, SSC CHSL cut-offs differ across posts and reservation categories, reflecting variations in vacancy distribution, candidate preference, and competition intensity. Despite frequent discussion among aspirants, systematic and data-driven analysis of these cut-off variations remains limited.

This study aims to address this gap by conducting a structured, longitudinal analysis of SSC CHSL Tier-I cut-off data over a five-year period. By integrating post-wise and category-wise perspectives with estimated competition density, the study seeks to identify the structural factors that consistently influence cut-off behavior and to demonstrate a reproducible, database-driven approach to examination data analysis.

## 2. Objectives of the Study

The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

1. To analyze SSC CHSL Tier-I cut-off trends over a five-year period (2019–2023).
2. To compare cut-off variations across different posts, namely LDC/JSA, PA/SA, and DEO.
3. To examine category-wise differences in cut-off marks across reservation categories.
4. To study the relationship between competition density and cut-off levels.
5. To demonstrate a structured, database-driven approach to analyzing competitive examination data.

## 3. Scope of the Study

This study is limited to the SSC CHSL Tier-I examination conducted between 2019 and 2023. The analysis covers three major posts—LDC/JSA, PA/SA, and DEO—and five reservation categories: UR, OBC, SC, ST, and EWS.

The study focuses on identifying relative trends and structural patterns in cut-off behavior rather than evaluating policy effectiveness or reservation outcomes. Factors such as shift-wise normalization, regional variation, and individual candidate performance are outside the scope of this analysis.

## 4. Data Sources and Collection

The data used in this study was collected from both primary and secondary sources to ensure accuracy, completeness, and transparency.

### 4.1 Primary Data Sources

Official cut-off marks for SSC CHSL Tier-I examinations were obtained from result and write-up documents published on the official website of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC). These documents provide post-wise and category-wise cut-off details and were treated as the authoritative source for cut-off data across all five years of analysis (2019–2023).

### 4.2 Secondary Data Sources

Secondary sources, including reputed examination preparation portals and publicly available reports, were used to cross-verify cut-off values and to obtain contextual information regarding candidate participation. These sources were used only for data structuring and validation purposes and not as primary authorities.

### 4.3 Candidate Participation Data

The SSC does not officially publish category-wise candidate appearance data. Therefore, candidate participation figures used in this study were estimated using a combination of total applicant statistics, reservation proportions, and publicly available exam analytics. All such figures are explicitly treated as estimates and are used solely to analyze relative competition density rather than absolute participation counts.
